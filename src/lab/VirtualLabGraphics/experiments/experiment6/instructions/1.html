<p>
This experiment is designed to teach the orthographic and perspective projections using cameras and a bunny.

The world represented as a tree is shown below.
Each node is an instance. Each instance has 3 sections: Coodinate system, shape/instance, Transformation.
Coordinate system is the local coordinate system of the instance.
Shape/Instance is the geometry or a child instance of the cuurent instance. Multiple shapes and child instances can be added where the child instance is again a node.
Transformation is the set of transformations applied to the shape or instance w.r.t the local coordinate system.
</p>
<p>
A Camera node is similar to an instance.
It has a <code>Coordinate system</code> which is a local coordinate system coordinate system wrt the Global fixed coordinate system. The camera is always placed at the origin of this <code>Coordinate system</code> looking towards -ve Z-axis.
The <code>Transformation</code> section is the same as the other nodes.
Camera node doesnt have a Shape/Instance section and hence no children can be added.
The rest of the parameters define the camera.
